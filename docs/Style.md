# Parasheet Style Guide

When writing code, please adhere to the following rules:
- Variable Names Should be at least 3 letters following
- Type names should be capitalized
- All names should be in camelCase.

Please run `clang-format` on your code before commiting it. This can be done with `cland-format -i <FILE>`. `clang-format` should automatically detect the `.clang-format` file that describes the formatting options. If you use an IDE, you can probably configure it to run `clang-format` automatically when you save a file.
